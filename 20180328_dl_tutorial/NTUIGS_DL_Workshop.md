## Proposed Deep Learning with Python Workshop

<center><img src="http://jxgu.cc/images/HomePage.png"></img></center>

The workshop is meant to introduce you to the concepts of deep learning and provide a solid base to build deeper knowledge in the field. You will learn:
1. Fundamentals of deep learning theory
2. How to approach and solve a problem with deep learning
3. Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network with Python on your PC

## Activities
The workshop is conceived to maximize the learning experience for everyone and includes 50% theory and 50% hands-on practice.

1. Introduction to Deep Learning and Neural networks (30 mins)
2. How to use Python (30 mins)
3. Break and Q/A (13 mins)
4. Building a Convolutional Neural Network with Python (Tensorflow) (around 45 mins)

## Pre-requisites?
Previous experience programming in Python or in other languages is advised to make the best use of the workshop.

#### Why python?
In the last 2 years, Python has become a standard in data science and is widely adopted by most major companies. Reasons for this success include:
the large set of mature data science libraries => most needs covered
the worldwide community of enthusiasts => get help when you need it
easy to learn, read and write => start contributing immediately
supports both functional and object-oriented coding => versatile and powerful
full stack programming language => easier interaction between data scientists and software engineers

#### Why Tensorflow?
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library and also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
